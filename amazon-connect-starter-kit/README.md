# Amazon Connect SMB Starter Kit

## Purpose
Designed for AWS Distribution Partners, SMB Starter Kits are packaged customer solutions that address key SMB greenfield use cases. They consist of templated go-to-market and technical content which AWS Distribution Partners can customize and launch with their Distribution sellers to begin selling AWS solutions to customers.

This Amazon Connect SMB Starter Kit is a pre-packaged solution which deploys an operational self-service Amazon Connect instance into a select account.
